# ecomm-translation-service

> Kubernetes Microservice in use for the translation of Electronic Communication messages and publishing based on the source's configured endpoint to a vendor's API. This repository has been scrubbed for any sensitive data for sharing.

### Current State
#### Translation Service Current State is as follows:
* Translation Service is functional end-to-end using **_MOCKED_** data
    * Sqs -> Polling Service -> EcommDb (**_Connection Only_**) -> Translate Ecomm Content JSON to OCRequestBody -> Ability to PUT Attachment files (**_byte[] datatype_**) to /v2/files endpoint -> POST final OCRequestBody to /v2/conversation endpoint -> Return reconciliation id (_plus error handling_)
* Starts with Autoscaled (Based on Queue Size) Pods configured to connect to the following:
    * SQS: ecomm-translation-sqs-int
    * S3: ecomm-common-api-int
    * OAUTH: GR Token Generation
    * OC_API: Ability to post Messages with or without attachments
        * /v2/conversations
        * /v2/files
    * JPA: ecomm-api-db-int-1:
        *  NOTE: All table configurations can be found by looking through the Entity classes
* Each Pod will start a scheduled poll to the queue
* Each Pod's polling listener will return 1 message per connection
* Each message is sent to OpenConnectorProxy where the message Translation to OC_RequestBody will occur
* That same service will then call OpenConnectorProxy to post the mocked OC_RequestBody via /v2/conversation

#### Postman Testing
Downloaded the latest Postman Collection .json in `./postman-testing/Collections`
* Service Tests (**_Requests send directly to local Translation-Service_**):
    * Base URL: `http://localhost:8443/api/v1/ecomm-translation-service`
    * TestE2EMockedMessageController
        * Endpoint: `/oc/mock/v2/files`
        * Description: General E2E Message flow through Translation Service:
            1. Using mocked json in Postman Body, sends mocked SqsMessage with _EcommContentId_ through **ecomm-translation-sqs-int**.
            2. SqsMessage will be picked up by the Polling Service which retrieves the _EcommContentId_ value and passes to OpenConnectorProxy.
            3. OpenConnectorProxy sends mocked OCRequestBody to OpenConnectorClient for posting a message to `/v2/conversation` without an attachment.
    * Local OC API Tests
        * TestMockedConversationController
            * Endpoint: `/oc/mock/v2/conversation`
            * Description: Use OpenConnectorProxy to publish **_MOCKED_** OCRequestBody to OC API `/v2/conversations`.
        * TestMockedConversationWithAttachmentController
            * Endpoint: `/oc/mock/v2/conversation/attachment`
            * Description: Use OpenConnectorProxy to publish **_MOCKED_** attachment-file.txt OC API `/v2/files` and OCRequestBody w/Attachment to `/v2/conversations`.
        * TestMockedAttachmentController
            * Endpoint: `/oc/mock/v2/files`
            * Description: Use OpenConnectorProxy to publish **_MOCKED_** attachment-file.txt OC API `/v2/files`.
* Open Connector Api V2 Tests (**_Not run through local Translation-Service_**):
    * Base URL: `https://conversations.api.globalrelay.com`
    * Conversation W/OAuth
        * Endpoint: `/v2/conversations`
        * Description: Sends mocked request body directly to OC API.
    * Conversation - Attach File W/OAuth
        * Endpoint: `/v2/conversations`
        * Description: Sends mocked request body with added file content to OC API.
    * File Upload W/OAuth
        * Prerequisite: Attach file through Post Request Body and replace `{file_key}` with the file name.
        * Endpoint: `/v2/files/default/{file_key}`
        * Description: Sends provided file as binary type to OC API.

#### Critical Bugs
* None!

### Purpose of Repository
* Deliver Ecomm Translation Service
* Deliver a Project which contains more Developer Driven Documentation than any other NM Gitlab Project.
    * Delivered from this feature will be documentation and training material allowing new and experienced Ecomm Devs to more easily:
        * Build New Services
        * Fork from Existing Services
        * Maintain Production Services
        * Debug Production Issues
        * Enhance Existing Services
        * Train New Developers
        * Allow Experienced Devs to give technical KT more organically.
        * The possibilities are endless!
    * Jacob is leading this effort
* Establish or work towards establishing basic standards across the following areas:
    * Development
    * Gitlab Repository Management
    * Code
    * DevOps

### Readme Maintenance & Guidelines for the benefit of the Development team
Please try to keep your Remaining Feature Work tasks updated when creating a MR for at least uat (develop would be ideal).
Feel free to add to any sections as you progress in development. Goal is to keep this a a som

### Definitions for Common Terms
* Ecomm - Electronic Communication
* OC API - Global Relays Open Connector API Service - /v2/

### Noted Dependencies
* Gradle
* Java
* Springboot
* AWS
* Apache

### Setting up the Translation Service Locally
#### Properties Configuration
Create application-local.properties file from example.application-local.properties
- Fill in the empty environment variables secrets
- Reach out to team if you need secret values
- Your application-local.properties may already be configured, so make sure this is cleaned up at least before uat if the case.

#### Running via Gradle - need BG-ADMIN access
1. Install the AWS CLI if you do not have it: <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html>
2. Grab AWS ENV variables from **NWM-LPA-NON** using the **BG-ADMIN** role here: <https://nm.awsapps.com/start#/>
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = XXXXX
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = XXXXX
    - AWS_SESSION_TOKEN = XXXXX
3. Copy and paste the 3 variables into the [./run-local.sh]() script in lines `4-6`.
4. Remove any `"` if present from Dashboard
5. Run script [./run-local.sh](run-local.sh) to start the project with the local spring profile.

#### Running via Docker
* TODO

#### Dependent Resources when running Locally
* Gradle Java Service - Running in the local profile on your machine at http://localhost:8443/api/v1/ecomm-translation-service
* AWS SQS - Running with int profile in account NWM-LPA-NON
  * Because your testing directly against int, be careful of mixing up messages if any other devs are connected to the SQS.
    * This will be ok long term due to branch management strategy and keeping qa and the most stable non-prod environment.
* AWS S3 - Running with int profile in account NWM-LPA-NON
  * S3Client is currently configured but not being used in Application
* AWS RDS - Not configured currently, but will run with int profile in account NWM-LPA-NON

#### Postman Testing
You will find everything needed in the /postman-testing folder to start api driven development and testing.
* Collection
  * Grab the json file from the Collection folder and import that into Postman. That should basically be it.
* Documentation
  * Folder contains Open-Connector specific documentation including swagger.yml file and reference pdf.
* Figure out how to call the /test-send-message api to push messages to the int-sqs to be consumed by your local machine.

This is a protected branch and should never be directly modified unless in an emergency.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| uat | qa | HUBQA/NMW-LPA-NON | Permanent | Ensure a stable version of NonProd is always running. | 1 Review and Approval Required | Code merged into this branch must be configured/tested for any qa specific resources before being merged. Keep this branch consistently running and stable; will revert from here if needed. The uat branch may merge into main. Try to maintain a resources/service level definition as much division as possible between uat and deploy. |
| develop | int                                                                  | HUBINT/NMW-LPA-NON | Permanent | Test deployments across all dev branches; testing ground for recent changes. It's okay if you break this, just clean up your messes. | 1 Review and Approval Required | The develop branch is your intermediate branch. The develop branch contains code that may be ahead of main but is behind any of the feature branches.                                                                                                                                                                                      |

This is where most of the work will happen in the Git environment. The feature branch may not merge into main.                                                                                                                                                                             |
